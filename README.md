# Qiskit Projects Repository

Welcome to the **Qiskit Projects Repository**! 🧑‍💻⚛️ This repository serves as a collection of quantum computing projects developed using Qiskit, IBM's open-source framework for quantum programming. It includes implementations, experiments, and explorations in quantum computing concepts.

## 🚀 Features

### 1. **Quantum Algorithms**
- **Grover's Algorithm**: Demonstrates quantum search optimization.
- **Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)**: Explores the foundation of quantum signal processing.
- **Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)**: Solves for the lowest eigenstate of a Hamiltonian.

### 2. **Quantum Circuits**
- Pre-built and modular circuits for quantum state preparation, entanglement, and measurement.
- Custom gates and decompositions.

### 3. **Simulations and Experiments**
- Simulations using Qiskit's Aer simulator.
- Experiments run on real quantum hardware via IBM Quantum Experience.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Qiskit (Install using pip: `pip install qiskit`)
- IBM Quantum account (for running circuits on real quantum hardware)

## 📦 Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/qiskit-projects.git
   cd qiskit-projects
   ```
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install qiskit
   ```
3. Run any project:
   ```bash
   python path/to/project.py
   ```

## 📄 Example

Here’s an example of a simple Bell State circuit:

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, execute

# Create a Quantum Circuit with 2 qubits and 2 classical bits
qc = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)

# Apply a Hadamard gate on qubit 0
qc.h(0)
# Apply a CNOT gate on qubit 0 and 1
qc.cx(0, 1)

# Measure the qubits
qc.measure([0, 1], [0, 1])

# Execute the circuit
simulator = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
result = execute(qc, simulator).result()
counts = result.get_counts()
print("Result:", counts)
```

## 🌟 Future Enhancements
- Add tutorials for beginners to Qiskit.
- Implement more advanced algorithms like Shor's Algorithm.
- Explore quantum machine learning with Qiskit ML.
- Visualize quantum circuits using Qiskit’s built-in tools.
